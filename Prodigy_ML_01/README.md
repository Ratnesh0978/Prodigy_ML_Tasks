House Price Prediction Project
# Overview
Welcome to the House Price Prediction Project, a comprehensive exploration of data analysis, machine learning, and model evaluation. In this repository, we leverage a linear regression model to predict house prices, focusing on key features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms. Let's delve into the details of this insightful project.

Dataset
The dataset utilized for this project is sourced from 'kc_house_data.csv'. This dataset encompasses various features pertinent to houses, including square footage, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and more. For in-depth training and evaluation of our predictive model, the dataset proves indispensable.

# Project Tasks
* Data Loading and Exploration *:

The dataset is ingested into a pandas DataFrame for thorough exploration.
Features are examined to extract valuable insights into the dataset.
Feature Selection and Preparation:

Relevance drives the selection of features: square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms.
A meticulous split of the data into training and testing sets lays the groundwork for model training.
# Model Development and Evaluation:

A linear regression model, implemented with scikit-learn, undergoes rigorous evaluation.
Performance metrics such as R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) illuminate the model's effectiveness.
Visualization techniques are employed to unravel intricate feature relationships.
Model Coefficients and Interpretation:

A granular analysis of model coefficients and intercept enriches our understanding of feature influence.
Predictions on New Data:

The model's prowess is demonstrated through predictions on new data, showcasing real-world applicability.
# Project Outcome
R-squared (RÂ²) Score: 0.509
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): $174,662.93
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): $272,465.84
The linear regression model exhibits a moderate performance, elucidating 50.9% of the variance in house prices. This analysis provides not only valuable insights into housing market dynamics but also lays the foundation for future enhancements and feature explorations.
